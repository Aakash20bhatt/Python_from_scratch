Given an integer array, which is sorted (in increasing order) and has been rotated by some number k in clockwise direction. 
Find and return the k.






def check(l,n):
    i=0
    while i<n-1:
        if l[i]>l[i+1]:
            return (i+1)
        i=i+1
    return 0
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(check(l,n))
