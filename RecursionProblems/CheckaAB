'''Suppose you have a string, S, made up of only 'a's and 'b's.
Write a recursive function that checks if the string was generated using the following rules:
a. The string begins with an 'a'
b. Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb"
c. Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a'  '''

    if len(s)==0:

        if s[1:3]=="bb" and len(s[1:])>1:
            return check(s[3:])
        else:
            return check(s[1:])
